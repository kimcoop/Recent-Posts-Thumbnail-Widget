Recent Posts with Thumbnail
===========================

This is a simple WordPress plugin that creates a recent posts widget that displays the post thumbnail and, optionally, the post title and date. You can select the number of posts to display and choose to hide or show the title and date.

Very little styling has been applied so that the theme designer, developer or use can easily customize the appearance.


Installation
------------
To install, download the plugins zip file. Within your WordPress admin, navigation to Plugins > Add New and click "Upload." Browse to the zip file and upload it, then click to activate it.

You'll then see a new widget in your Appearance > Widgets screen. Add the widget to your sidebar and configure and style as desired.
